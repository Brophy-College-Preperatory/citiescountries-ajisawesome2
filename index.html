  <h2>Difference Between Class and ID</h2> <!--this line of code inserts the title of the website-->
  <p>A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an ID name must only be used by one HTML element within the page. In the CSS file, a class will be styled with a period while an ID will be styled with a hashtag. Using classes and IDs will allow you to style items of the same tag (paragraph, image, anchor, etc.) differently. </p>
